# 🆙 Redis Use Cases

## 💸 Were to use Redis?

"All Redis data resides in memory, which enables low latency and hugh throughput data access." (1)
This advantages led to the following Use Cases:

- Caching
- Chat, messageing, and queues
- Gaming leaderboards
- Session storage
- Rich media streaming
- Geospatial
- Maschine learning
- Real-time analytics

In the next sections we will explain in detail about the Use Cases.
These are just Use Cases listed by Amazon AWS, there are definitely many other Use Cases but these are common used ones.

## 🍷 Caching

Redis can be used as a cache and is a great choice because of the highly available in-memory cache. Redis as cache can decrease data access latency. increase throughput, and ease of load off your relational or NoSQL database and application. Two reasons, why Redis is realy good for caching data (1):

- can serve frequently requested times at sub-millisecon respons times
- enables easily scale for higher loads without growing the costlier backend.

Examples for caching are: Database query results caching, persostent session caching, web page caching, and caching of frequently used obects such as images, files, and metadata. (1)
